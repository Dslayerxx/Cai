you give it a max 20 char prompt and it will give you a 500 char long message
then you can say which AI did it the best, that AI will copy with mutation and
you give it a new prompt and then repeat until the AI gives legible stories


the network will be 7 layers:
32-32-32-64-128-256-512
which is 1056 neurons
with per layer then connection amount of:
1024-1024-2048-8192-32768-131072
total: 176128
total amount of values needed: 177184

every 5 char it can encounter a new number in the weights


the ACII output is normalized with being from 1 to 96
and + 31

first layer needs to normalize the input characters and multiply this with
the weights of each neuron to then be filtered trough the sigmoid function

to get the current value, add the
-48
